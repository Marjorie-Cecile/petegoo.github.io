<p>I’m giving a talk on Thursday 15th September at the North Shore .Net users group in Auckland on Visual Studio Extensibility, DSL Tools and T4 Code Generation.</p>
<p>Quadrangle B;&#160; Seminar Room 3(QB3), Massey University, Albany </p>
<p><a name="SPBookmark_EventDate"></a>Start Time: 15/09/2011 5:45 p.m. </p>
<blockquote><p>We’ll look at how to increase your productivity by creating your own simple extensions to visual studio. Then we’ll delve a little deeper and look at how DSL tools and T4 text templating allow you to apply the patterns of Model Driven Development to take away all those boring repetitive tasks, leaving you with the time to concentrate on the real problems. We'll see examples of how we have managed to successfully apply these techniques to our development lifecycle and products at ADERANT.</p>
