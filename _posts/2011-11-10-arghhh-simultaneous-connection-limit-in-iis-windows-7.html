<p>I’ve been playing with <a title="SignalR" href="https://github.com/SignalR" target="_blank">SignalR</a> recently and it drives me nuts that I can’t have more than a few simultaneous long polling requests open to the IIS server on Windows 7. It stops responding after about 2 clients. Even IIS Express supports unlimited simultaneous connections but we need AppFabric support.</p>
<p>We would seriously consider using it for our messaging solution but on a single machine developer install, we would need to come up with another solution for our many client apps.</p>
