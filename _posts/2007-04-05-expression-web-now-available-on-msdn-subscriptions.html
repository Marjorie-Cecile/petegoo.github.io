<p>Microsoft have finally listened to all the developers (who are also designers) rightfully throwing our toys out of our prams and included Expression Web Designer and possibly some other Expression badged products in the MSDN subscription downloads.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><strong><em>"...we received a lot of questions about why we did not include some of these products, particularly Expression Web, within customers? MSDN subscriptions.........Based on this feedback, I am pleased to say that we will be making Expression Web available starting today to all MSDN Premium subscribers"</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really good news. The presumption that developers never need to use the latest CSS and HTML tools as they don't do design is ridiculous. Those of us building functional internal web solutions rarely get the option of enlisting the services of a dedicated designer, leaving the lonely developer to struggle with whatever tools are available to accomplish design.</p>
