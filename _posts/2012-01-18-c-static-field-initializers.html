<p>I hit a problem recently where a singleton I was calling from an assembly resolver was throwing an exception. It turned out that the sync object used in the lock for the <a title="MSDN C# Singleton Pattern" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650316.aspx" target="_blank">singleton pattern</a> was null. How was this possible? Look at the code below:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp;">using System;

public sealed class Singleton
{
   private static volatile Singleton instance;
   private static readonly object syncRoot = new Object();

   private Singleton() {}

   public static Singleton Instance
   {
      get 
      {
         if (instance == null) 
         {
            lock (syncRoot) 
            {
               if (instance == null) 
                  instance = new Singleton();
            }
         }

         return instance;
      }
   }
}</pre>
<p>How can this be, my static readonly field should be set by the field initializer. This should be run before itâ€™s first usage. Normally, this is true but for some reason this was not the case. The C#spec though gives us a workaround, implement a static constructor. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645612(v=vs.71).aspx" target="_blank">section on static constructors</a> states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a class contains any static fields with initializers, those initializers are executed in textual order immediately prior to executing the static constructor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, if we add a static constructor to our Singleton class, we get guaranteed initialization of the static field initializers before it is run, also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The static constructor for a class executes at most once in a given application domain. The execution of a static constructor is triggered by the first of the following events to occur within an application domain:</p>
<ul>
<li>An instance of the class is created. </li>
<li>Any of the static members of the class are referenced. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore our static constructor will run before our singleton Instance property.</p>
