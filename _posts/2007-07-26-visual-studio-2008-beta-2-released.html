<p>First impressions are really good. The install went fine on a dual core laptop in parallel with VS 2005 already installed. The first thing I notice is that the performance is good (no worse than 2005) and the XAML designer is much improved over the cider CTPs.</p>
<p>Had a quick play with LINQ on a generic list and the intellisense support seems spot on.</p>
<p>Must sleep now.</p>
