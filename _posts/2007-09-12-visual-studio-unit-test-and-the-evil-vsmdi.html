<p align="left"><span>During a recent project we found a recurring problem where the test view of the unit (&amp; integration) test projects would not load and we could not run tests. This was typically seen by the Test View load progress bar sitting at around 99%. This just adds to the list of "features" of VSTS Unit Test that make life oh so irritating</p>
<p>It is due to the corruption of the *.vsmdi files in the visual studio solution which is caused by auto-merging the content of the file or having the test view property window open when getting the latest version.</p>
<p> The problem is outlined in this blog post (also note the comments for possible workarounds)</p>
