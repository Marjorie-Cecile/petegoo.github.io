<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent" target="_blank">Stuart Kent</a> has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2008/11/05/dsl-tools-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx" target="_blank">blogged about</a> the new features they are planning for DSL Tools in the Visual Studio 2010 timeframe. Of particular interest are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dsl extensibility</strong>. Extend the domain model and behavior for a DSL after it's been deployed, including DSLs shipped by a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Readonly</strong>. Selectively switch off the ability to edit models and model elements in a designer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forms-based UI</strong>. Easily bind models to winforms and WPF-based forms UI. IMS now implements the necessary databinding interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modelbus</strong>. A new piece of platform to support cross-referencing between models and interaction between designers. This has been one of customers' main requests. This one kind of blows my <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/DslCrossModel" target="_blank">codeplex</a> project out of the water, which is probably a good thing as I can't find the time to finish it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>T4 precompile</strong>. Precompile text templates so that they can be deployed for use on machines that do not have VS installed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also of interest are the various blog entries on the overlap between DSL and Oslo from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2008/11/07/dsl-tools-and-oslo.aspx" target="_blank">Stuart Kent</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2008/11/06/oslo-and-the-dsl-toolkit.aspx" target="_blank">Keith Short</a>. Personally I think Oslo is a huge step forward for Model-Driven architectures and shows a willingness to provide something useful for developers which does more than simply expand the already disparate tooling.</p>
