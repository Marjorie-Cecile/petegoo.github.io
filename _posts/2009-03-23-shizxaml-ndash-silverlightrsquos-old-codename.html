<p>According to <a title="Mike Harsh blog" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mharsh/" target="_blank">Mike Harsh</a> in his Mix talk on <a href="http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/T45F" target="_blank">Silverlight 3.0 – Out of Browser</a>, before silverlight was WPF/E, internally Microsoft were calling it <strong><em>Shizxaml</em></strong>. I so wish this had been the product name. “Lets shizxaml that sucker” and the like. Brilliant!</p>
